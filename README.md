##Personal Site

This is my personal website.
It will host 4 main sections, Home, About me, my projects and contact information.

The current landing page is done using Flexbox while the finished site will be done using Bootstrap 4.

I am always open to feedback which is one of the reasons I am using Github to host the site. I believe in open source and constant improvement. Thanks for visiting!
